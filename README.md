# Closet Helper Backend

This application implements the backend functionality of [Closet Helper](https://github.com/miaschroeder/closet-helper-frontend),
a web application that assists the user in planning their outfits by recommending clothing articles based on weather, style,
and user preferences.

## How It Works

Built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, the backend of Closet Helper facilitates requests from the frontend to create, read, edit,
and delete clothing items from three clothing collections in MongoDB, which represent clothing categories of tops, bottoms, and outerwear.
